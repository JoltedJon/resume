- Managed thousands of user's accounts and permissions on Windows and Linux systems

% Projects
\section*{Projects}
\noindent \textbf{Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator}
- Currently developing a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator using Rust.
Fully functional 6502 processor emulator with correct cycle. Will have video and audio capabilities, and ability to interface with controllers.

\textit{Technologies Used:} Rust, SDL2, Memory Mapped IO

\noindent \textbf{Fully Synthesizable P6 N-Way Superscalar Processor} \\
\textit{Collaborative Project with a team of 7} \\
- Contributed to the development of a fully synthesizable Out of Order P6 N-way superscalar RISC-V processor, emphasizing high performance and efficient execution.
Developed working branch predictor, 32-bit multiplier, Reorder buffer, functional units, Common Data Bus, and Early Branch Resolution.  \\
- Independently developed a visual debugger for the processor in C++,
utilizing Ncurses to enhance debugging capabilities.
Employed the use of linux pipes for inter-process communication between the SystemVerilog code
and the C++ code, enabling real-time data exchange.

\textit{Technologies Used:} SystemVerilog, C++, Ncurses

\noindent \textbf{Network Filesystem} \\
- Engineered a server filesystem in C++ enabling client command processing via sockets.
Implemented dynamic memory allocation for upgradeable reader-writer locks,
facilitating multiple readers or exclusive writer access. Dynamically allocating the locks, making use of RAII design principle and smart pointers.

\textit{Technologies Used:} C++, Sockets, TCP, Smart Pointers, Threads, Boost Library

\noindent \textbf{Thread Library} \\
- Designed and implemented a functional thread library. Dynamically created contexts that could be swapped to.
Included feature to acquire mutexes, and atomically put context on waiting queue and drop mutex lock by implementing a Condition Variable class.
Could properly handle multiple processors attempting to access the thread library by utilizing atomic guards, and spin locks.

\textit{Technologies Used:} C++, Interrupts, Library Implementation, Multiprocessor, Object Oriented Programming


\noindent \textbf{Memory Page Table}\\
- Created an OS page table that allocated space in RAM for pages. Could handle swap-backed and file-backed pages.
Would evict pages from the page table in order for the computer to allocate more space in RAM.
Processes that were forked would share pages, and would enact a copy-on-write policy to efficiently use the RAM space.

\textit{Technologies Used:} C++, Smart Pointers, Object Oriented Programming

\noindent \textbf{Instagram Clone with React and JavaScript} \\
- Developed a client-side dynamic Instagram clone using React and JavaScript,
featuring infinite scroll. Integrated a REST API and Flask for backend communication,
with SQLite3 for database management.

\textit{Technologies Used:} Python, JavaScript, React, SQLite3, Flask, AWS

\noindent \textbf{Scheme Lexer} \\
- Built a Lexer for a subset of R5RS Compliant Scheme. Could produce tokens that could be parsed and interpretted.

\textit{Technologies Used:} Scheme, Functional Programming

\noindent \textbf{Web Security} \\
- Simulated attacking a provided insecure website using SQL
injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery
(CSRF). Learned to spot common vulnerabilities and the
weaknesses of naive defenses to avoid using them in personal web
applications.
- Examined and exploited C code that was vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Utilized Ghidra to
decompile executable to spot any potential vulnerabilities.

\textit{Technologies Used:} Python, Javascript, Ghidra, C
